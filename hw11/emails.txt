An staff member of DJJ and the sheriff's dept. raided our Arcadia center based on testimony of a habitual lying juvenile girl. She was at a routine doctors appointment and lied about several things which caused the report. The officer of DJJ without investigating raided our center with four sheriff's cars and took 6 girls out of our program. NO investigation on the girls story, no talking with the Director on the records to prove the child a lier. Called all the parents and told lies that not only scared the heck out of the parents but also destroyed our program. They had no cause to react this way, based on a 16 year old girl's story, who's own mother says she is a habitual lier. I will get you the exact details as I am in Puerto Rico in a board meeting and will be in Florida on Sunday. I would like for you to call me back. \n\nWe have some 200 beds for juvenile girls and boys in Florida now and are not costing the state one dime. We are not crying and complaining about not getting the support of the state. We are doing our job in helping these kids get their lives right with God and their parents. Now.

In this Bill is contained wording about how the county AND school board could each impose a 1/2 cent sales surtax...WITH A SUPERMAJORITY SCHOOL BOARD VOTE! (5 yea,2 nea)\n \nSo while I was researching information on the SAP/R3 computer system (a much, too much money pit!) I ran across something very interesting about this \"surtax\" that I was not fully aware of...and I would bet that the general public doesn't know either. This proposed surtax in SB382 refers to Capital Expenses ONLY!\n \nCapital money is used primarily to pay for building construction and renovation, but not building maintenance. Capital money also covers the cost of other big-ticket items such as school buses and computers (SAP/R3).\nUnlike county and municipal governments, school districts cannot mix capital and operating expenses. Operating funds cover the day-to-day expense of running the school district. Salaries, supplies, student transportation, and building maintenance are all included in the operating budget. \n \nThis means NONE of this money derived from the surtax could be used for anything other than capital expenses...new schools and school renovations! NO WAGE INCREASES FROM THIS TAX>>>PERIOD!\nSo, if you thought that by supporting a surtax increase for the school district would help the teacher wage problem, or help in reducing the student/teacher ratio, or help in keeping those truant officers employed in order to reduce the dropout rates, or any thing else you might have thought...well your WRONG!\n \nThis Bill WILL help build more schools, and make the building of those new schools better because corners will not have to be cut because of funding. It will also help in getting rid of those ugly portable classrooms we all hate. And the gyms, music buildings, cafeterias, and the like could also be built where needed. But what this will ultimately do is create unusable square footage of building space...BECAUSE...the state continues to short school districts on operating funding! AND the school district's school board continues to go unchecked with their un-satisfiable appetite for spending operating funds in a crazy manner.\n \nSorry Polk County Teachers and support personel...no raise for you even if this bad legislation AS WRITTEN does pass. The rest of the SB382 Bill looks pretty good as it puts increased pressure on the growth management issue going unchecked, and it FORCES the builders, county governments, and school districts to work together in reducing the problems incurred with unchecked growth. If we could only get the wording changed a wee little bit on this SB382 Bill that would allow a certain portion of the surtax to be used by the school district for operating expenses that are SENSIBLE (teacher and support personel wages???)...\nwe just might have a good Bill that we all could support.\n \nPlease write your Senators and give them you opinions on this Bill. Either way, this Bill will be passed this year...like it or NOT! \n\nSB382\nRead all about it at...\nhttp://www.leg.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session <http://www.leg.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&Submenu=1&FT=D&File=sb0382.html&Directory=session/2002/Senate/bills/billtext/html/> &Submenu=1&FT=D&File=sb0382.html&Directory=session/2002/Senate/bills/billtext/html/\n \nThank you for your continued support!\n \nBryan Siddell\nhttp://polk-ed.com/\nbfsid@ithink.net","id":"20020112-002c01c19b5d$b00891e0$cd0abecf@robert","subject":"Fw: the tax Bill is back!","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T05:38:37-06:00"},{"from":"PiGoose@aol.com","to":"jeb@jeb.org","date":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 07:33:42 EST","message":"Jeb - \n\nDr. Ellen Pikitch is the Director of Marine Conservation at the Wildlife Conservation Society, New York City, and among other things a world authority on shark populations. \n\nOtis and I are hopeful that she will be joining the scientific staff at Rosenstiel in the near future. \n\nCould you possibly find a way to work her in to your busy schedule?

The attention rekindled disputes between fishermen and\n  conservationists, who argue there are more recreational swimmers, not more\n  sharks.\n\n    In 2000, worldwide shark attacks reached a record 85. Florida, North\nCarolina\n  and Alabama hit records of 38, five and two, respectively.\n\n    Quotas, which already had been cut in half since federal management\nbegan in\n  1993, will remain at 1997 levels for the season that began Jan. 1. The\ndispute\n  only affects commercial fishermen in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico,\nwhere most\n  shark fishing and most shark attacks occur.\n\n    Fisheries officials say the outcome of the next assessment, which may be\n  complete in April, is uncertain.  \"The modeling may give us a different\npicture\n  on where sharks are and where sharks have been,\" said Margo Schulze-Haugen, a\n  government fisheries biologist.\n\n    Conservation groups denounced the decision, saying fishermen hijacked a\n  process meant to guard against overfishing. They worried the episode\nwould fuel\n  challenges to other conservation efforts while allowing depletion of shark\n  stocks.\n\n    \"I would think the industry would be pretty encouraged by what happened,\"\n  said Ellen Pikitch, director of marine programs for the Wildlife Conservation\n  Society.\n\n    Fishermen plan to use this case as proof that fisheries management needs an\n  overhaul and more scientific oversight. Leaders of at least two large fishing\n  associations plan a lobbying trip to Washington next month.\n\n    \"It gives us hope that the system will be improved and that the scientific\n  work on which so much of the regulations are based will be given much better\n  consideration,\" Southeastern Fisheries Association Director Bob Jones said.\n\n    The independent scientists concluded that the 1998 study wasn't based\non the\n  best science or that inappropriate models were used. A principle target\nof their\n  criticism was a population model suggested by the three Wildlife Conservation\n  Society members on the 22-member assessment panel, prompting one independent\n  reviewer to question the objectivity of the process.\n\n    Meanwhile, experts on both sides predict more attacks this summer. The\nreason\n  depends on the source.\n\n    Fishermen argue that sharp declines in shark fishing since state and\nfederal\n  restrictions took effect in the early 1990s correspond to the attack\nincrease.\n\n    Mr. Jones said he has asked Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to allow commercial\n  fishermen to hunt sharks near shore or to use shark nets around public\nbeaches.\n  Florida, where nearly 60 percent of the nation's federal commercial\npermits are\n  held, has practically banned commercial shark fishing within state waters and\n  limited recreational catches since 1992.\n\n    \"It seems to me that they ought to be at least thinking about it instead of\n  sitting with their fingers crossed hoping people don't get chewed up this\nyear,\"\n  Mr. Jones said.  \"It is almost a death blow to Florida's tourist economy.\"\n\n    In the 1950's, when reporting was much spottier than it is now, there were\n  about 100 recorded attacks worldwide. In the 1990's there were 536.\n\n    George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File at the\n  University of Florida in Gainesville, points to data showing that steady\n  population growth in Florida and the world's other shark attack hotspots\n  parallels the increase.\n\n    He concedes that shark populations have rebounded since management efforts\n  began, but slowly. Mr. Burgess said a coastal population boom is causing\nmost of\n  the problem.\n\n    \"Humans, frankly, are flooding sharks out of their own water,\" he said.\n\n    The reviewers made suggestions about how to conduct the population\nstudy. For\n  example, they said, sharks differ from other fish because they mature slowly,\n  often reaching breeding age after 10 or 20 years, and that should be\ntaken into\n  account. Another issue is counting a population that roams widely.\n\n    Experts agree, however, that age and migration data isn't available for\nmost\n  sharks, which remain relatively mysterious.\n\n    For conservationists, what's at stake is the ability to conserve\nspecies when\n  evidence of low numbers exists but scientific data isn't complete.\n\n    \"If the way people react to uncertain science is to do nothing, that means\n  we're setting a precedent to allow fish stocks go down the tubes,\" Ms.\nPikitch\n  said.\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: ROBERT HOLST / NYTRENG (chart)\n\nLOAD-DATE: January 8,

I know you \n\nare a busy lady and I don't always expect you to be available for \nassistance. \nHowever, this is the situation: \nThe Health Care Quality Dept. in the Dept. of Health that performed \nnursing \nlicensure had a regional office in Jacksonville until December.  I am \ntold \nthey consolidated the Jax offcie into the Tally office to save costs \n(makes \nsense).  However, since the advent of the move, Carol Raymond tells me \nthat \nout-of state reciprocity licensure of nurses has come to a stand still \nand \nnew licensure of recent graduateas (LPNs and RNs) has as well.  The \nFlorida \nHospital Assoc. contact who has been trying to deal with this has not \nmet \nwith any success.  Perhaps the move has caused backlog and/or confusion. \nIn the past, once a student has completed the coursework for LPN \nlicensure \nor RN licensure, the school sends notification of this to the Board of \nNursing within the Health Care Quality Dept. in the DOH.  They do a \ncursory \nbackground check and issue a card that in essense states the student is \neligible to take nursing boards and sets a date for them to do so.  The \nissuance of this card allows the hiring entity to utilize them in their \ngraduate practice category pending their taking the Boards.  Halifax has \n8 \npeople caught in this holdup that are greatly needed on the nursing \nfloors. \n\nBoth the legislature and the Governor have been very interested in and \nproactive in addressing the nursing shortage.  These are nurses that are \n\nready to practice and cannot do so because of this situation. \nYour thoughts? \n\n\nDeanna Schaeffer \nPresident/CEO \nHealthy Communities \n655-A N.

I am very concerned regarding the Med Waiver DS services directory.  I think it is a violation of the Prado Steiman agreement and a violation of the Olmstead Supreme court decision and the Executive Order signed by President Bush for the swift implementation of the Olmstead decision.  I think we are taking giant steps backwards to the way things used to be, continuing to condemn persons with developmental disabilities in Florida to segregation, dependency and isolation, keeping them away from being able to access life and society.  I am also deeply concerned regarding the way some providers are violating the law and violating the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities, especially in the area of supported employment, and are able to get away with it.  The Department, at least in my district, is not concerned with the rights of individuals with disabilities and participate in the discrimination and violation of the rights of these individuals.  In Florida, individuals with developmental disabilities have no access to protection or to advocacy.  The only agency that is mandated to provide such protection and advocacy does a very poor job and in my opinion is a worthless agency and a parasite in our society.  In my opinion, this agency should be defunded. Florida will be better off setting aside legal advocacy funds to be provided directly to the individuals that need it so that they can go and buy their own legal representation whenever they need it.  Children with disabilities and their families have no access to the legal system because of lack of access to legal representation.\n\nI am unable to attend the rule development workshop in Tallahassee for two reasons:  1) I just learned about the workshop and 2) I have no funds to leave my home and travel to Tallahassee.  Please let me know what I can do to offer comments and to participate in the rule development process.  It seems that Tallahassee forgets that there is more to Florida, much more, than just Tallahassee.  \n\nI will await further information for my participation and my son's participation in this important process.\n\nLilliam Rangel-Diaz and Juan O.

During 2001, Enterprise\nTechnology Partners (ETP) invested heavily in human, infrastructure and\norganizational capabilities in both our information technology\nconsulting and capital equipment services business segments. ETP had\nsuccess in providing services to the private sector and federal and\nlocal governments. While disappointed with the level of opportunities at\nthe State level, we continue to be excited about the prospects of\nforming a strategic business relationship with the State of Florida\nearly in 2002. We are hopeful that, in the near future, project\nmanagement assignments are awarded from DMS in connection with the\nRetirement Information Management Systems project, as well as, other\nenterprise initiatives.\n\nRegarding telecommunications, ETP embraces your vision for utilizing an\nenterprise telecommunication model as a driving force to reduce costs\nand help grow the State's economy. Also, ETP understands the State's\ntelecom needs and would like very much to partner with the State and\nbecome the vendor of choice in providing consulting services in this\nimportant area. We believe we can aid in creating significant value in\nassisting in planning and implementing the powerful and efficient\nenterprise telecommunication system you envision.\n\nETP would like to have the opportunity to serve as \"Integrator\" for the\nState's Next Generation Network initiative. In such a role, ETP could\nserve as the \"integrator\"/ \"buffer\" between STO and the State's eligible\ntelecom providers.\n\nIn connection with expanding our core in telecommunications, Tim Walsh\njoined ETP to head our Telecommunication Practice. Tim is a recognized\nexpert in telecommunications. He has 15 years experience working in the\ntelecommunications field and has been the lead corporate account manager\nfor Verizon working with the Department of Management Services/State\nTechnology Office  (DMS/STO).\n\nYour help in ETP gaining an opportunity to partner with DMS/STO in\nimplementing a Florida Next Generation Network as well as other\ninformation technology projects would greatly be appreciated.\n\nThank you again for you help.\n\nJoshua","id":"20020112-AFE0EF96DE9ADE4EB4A7BF95FDF620685AEAF7@mi8nycmail05.mi8.com","subject":"RE: Joshua High  Business Update fup","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T08:59:57-06:00"},{"from":"\"Shanahan, Kathleen\" <kathleen.shanahan@myflorida.com>","to":"\"Wainwright, Tara\" <tara.wainwright@myflorida.com>,","date":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 11:26:55 -0500","message":"pls handle\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Wainwright, Tara \nSent: Friday, January 11, 2002 12:18 PM\nTo: Shanahan, Kathleen; DiBenigno, Arlene; Sasser, Charla\nCc: 'jeb@jeb.org'\nSubject: RE: Ltr to Governor Bush regarding event attendance.DOC\n\n\ngovernor will be on his way to DC...maybe a letter\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Shanahan, Kathleen \nSent: Friday, January 11, 2002 12:17 PM\nTo: DiBenigno, Arlene; Wainwright, Tara; Sasser, Charla\nCc: 'jeb@jeb.org'\nSubject: FW: Ltr to Governor Bush regarding event attendance.DOC\n\n\npls review/consider and respond\n\nthanks\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Stogner, Denise [mailto:denise.stogner@lowndes-law.com]\nSent: Wednesday, January 09, 2002 1:46 PM\nTo: 'jeb@jeb.org'; 'kathleen.shanahan@myflorida.com'\nSubject: Ltr to Governor Bush regarding event attendance.DOC\n\n\n <<Ltr to Governor Bush regarding event attendance.DOC>>","id":"20020112-C8BC3BBADF5DD5118A5C0004AC4CCAFC01908628@govexch.eog.state.fl.us","subject":"RE: Ltr to Governor Bush regarding event attendance.DOC","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T10:26:55-06:00"},{"from":"\"Sara Struhs\" <sstruhs@nettally.com>","to":"jeb@jeb.org","date":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 11:28:32 -0500","message":"Governor:\n\nYou may receive a call over the weekend or on Monday from Governor Barnes.\nOn Tuesday we will be prepared to allow the compact to expire and end\nnegotiations -- whether or not an agreement is reached.\n\nWe have recently brought in a fresh set of eyes to review where we are.  Lee\nWilson is a preeminent water allocation expert, and has represented both\nupstream and downstream interests under much larger compacts in other parts\nof the country.  He has independently confirmed what I advised you of some\nweeks ago: that we have reached the point where we can actually better\nprotect Florida's interests through administrative appeals and, if\nnecessary, litigation than we are by conceding any more of our water\ninterests.\n\nThe Nature Conservancy (the lead national environmental group on this\nissues) as well as the more local environmental interests will fully and\npublicly support Florida's decision to allow the compact to expire.  Indeed,\nI do not believe any Florida constituents will be disappointed.\n\nIf you happen to be told that Georgia has \"given\" Florida all (or much) of\nour requested stateline flow numbers, please be aware of the fact that at\nthe same time, Georgia has substantially changed the \"trigger\" for releasing\nthose flows.  Releases of water to Florida is driven, in part, on the\n\"composite storage\" (i.e. cumulative amount of water) being held in two\nreservoirs.  The composite storage is measured in \"zones\" (Zone 1 is the\nfullest, Zone 4 is the least full).\n\nWhile Georgia has moved closer to our needed flows, they have redefined Zone\n4 half way into Zone 3.  While it allows Georgia to point to a table and say\nthey are meeting Florida's numbers, the redefined release triggers in fact\nkeeps much of that water unavailable.\n\nThere are a number of other similar types of problems that continue to\nfrustrate our ability to achieve a fair compromise.  I believe we have\nreached the point where we will be better served (even with the uncertainty,\ndelay and substantial cost) by having a judge or court-appointed special\nmaster arbitrate these issues.\n\nCall me, of course, if you wish to discuss further.

I know you \n\nare a busy lady and I don't always expect you to be available for \nassistance. \nHowever, this is the situation: \nThe Health Care Quality Dept. in the Dept. of Health that performed \nnursing \nlicensure had a regional office in Jacksonville until December.  I am \ntold \nthey consolidated the Jax offcie into the Tally office to save costs \n(makes \nsense).  However, since the advent of the move, Carol Raymond tells me \nthat \nout-of state reciprocity licensure of nurses has come to a stand still \nand \nnew licensure of recent graduateas (LPNs and RNs) has as well.  The \nFlorida \nHospital Assoc. contact who has been trying to deal with this has not \nmet \nwith any success.  Perhaps the move has caused backlog and/or confusion. \nIn the past, once a student has completed the coursework for LPN \nlicensure \nor RN licensure, the school sends notification of this to the Board of \nNursing within the Health Care Quality Dept. in the DOH.  They do a \ncursory \nbackground check and issue a card that in essense states the student is \neligible to take nursing boards and sets a date for them to do so.  The \nissuance of this card allows the hiring entity to utilize them in their \ngraduate practice category pending their taking the Boards.  Halifax has \n8 \npeople caught in this holdup that are greatly needed on the nursing \nfloors. \n\nBoth the legislature and the Governor have been very interested in and \nproactive in addressing the nursing shortage.

The National Guard Bureau\ndidn't\nnotice (it was done close to the holidays) and the news broke late this\nweek\nthat 70 Guardsmen in Florida would be let go (43 from the ports; the\nothers\nfrom intelligence analysis support and other headquarters type\nfunctions.\n\n        Newspapers and TV stations have been calling today about it.\n\n        Senator Graham's office called me about it today, and,\nindirectly,\nSenator Nelson's.\n\n        The Florida Guard has raised the issue, and their initial\nrequest to\nme was to have you reach either the President or the SECDEF about it.  I\nthink that is an option, but way low down on the priority of options.\n\n        Therefore, the way out, I think is as follows:\n\n                To the press:  I have been responding that 1) The\nGuardsmen\nare an important part of your counterdrug strategy.  They do good work,\nand\nFlorida's ports lead the nations in interdictions (we get 2/3 rds of the\nnational port take, by numbers of seizures and by amounts of seizures).\nWe,\ntherefore, are working with Washington to find a way to keep our\nGuardsmen\non the job.\n\n                To the National Guard:  This is a National Guard Bureau\nissue.  The national level should lead in the effort to correct what at\nbest\nwas an oversight (they should have been watching).\n\n                The state of Florida:  Florida needs 2.5M to keep those\n70\nat work the rest of the year.  We should go after 2.5M.  Nelson will do\nthis; Graham will do this; I will do this; and your office (i.e., Nina,\nKathleen) can contact the right people in Department of Defense.  In the\ngrand scheme of things, $2.5M in the DoD budget is \"rounding errors\".\n\n                Other options:  1) We can keep everybody working until\nwe\nrun out of money, then let everybody (not just 70) go.

The National Guard Bureau\ndidn't\nnotice (it was done close to the holidays) and the news broke late this\nweek\nthat 70 Guardsmen in Florida would be let go (43 from the ports; the\nothers\nfrom intelligence analysis support and other headquarters type\nfunctions.\n\n        Newspapers and TV stations have been calling today about it.\n\n        Senator Graham's office called me about it today, and,\nindirectly,\nSenator Nelson's.\n\n        The Florida Guard has raised the issue, and their initial\nrequest to\nme was to have you reach either the President or the SECDEF about it.  I\nthink that is an option, but way low down on the priority of options.\n\n        Therefore, the way out, I think is as follows:\n\n                To the press:  I have been responding that 1) The\nGuardsmen\nare an important part of your counterdrug strategy.  They do good work,\nand\nFlorida's ports lead the nations in interdictions (we get 2/3 rds of the\nnational port take, by numbers of seizures and by amounts of seizures).\nWe,\ntherefore, are working with Washington to find a way to keep our\nGuardsmen\non the job.\n\n                To the National Guard:  This is a National Guard Bureau\nissue.  The national level should lead in the effort to correct what at\nbest\nwas an oversight (they should have been watching).\n\n                The state of Florida:  Florida needs 2.5M to keep those\n70\nat work the rest of the year.  We should go after 2.5M.  Nelson will do\nthis; Graham will do this; I will do this; and your office (i.e., Nina,\nKathleen) can contact the right people in Department of Defense.  In the\ngrand scheme of things, $2.5M in the DoD budget is \"rounding errors\".\n\n                Other options:  1) We can keep everybody working until\nwe\nrun out of money, then let everybody (not just 70) go.  A bad option\nunless\nthere is a federal \"supplemental\" (which given a state of war, there\nprobably will be).  2) We find alternative sources of money (US\nCongress,\nexisting National Guard allocations, etc. -- but not state money).  3)\nWrap\nthis up with terrorist-related National Guard issues.\n\n                Bottom line:  I will work.

St. Petersburg Times\n1/11/02\n\n\nYears of service, killed in a minute\nBy LUCY MORGAN, Times Tallahassee Bureau Chief\n© St. Petersburg Times\npublished January 11, 2002\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe men and women who work for the Florida Legislature have always known\nit\nis possible for them to lose their jobs on a whim, but the peril under\nwhich\nthey work was again made clear this week in the Florida Senate.\n\nSarah Jane Bradshaw, a state employee for 29 years and six months --\njust a\nhalf-year short of having the 30 years she needs to collect decent\nretirement benefits now -- was fired late Tuesday.\n\nNo one will say why it happened, just that Senate President John McKay\nwas\nexercising his prerogative to dismiss a Senate employee who served at\nhis\npleasure. McKay sent chief of staff Greg Krasovsky to deliver the news.\n\n\"I made the decision that I thought we needed a change in that\nposition,\"\nMcKay said. \"Those are personnel issues that aren't supposed to be in\nthe\npress.\"\n\nIt was McKay's pleasure to fire the staff director at the Senate Ethics\nand\nElections Committee after all of her years of service. Before her chair\nwas\ncold, the job was filled by Wayne Rubinas, a lawyer who happened be a\nhigh\nschool classmate of McKay's. But McKay hastens to add that he wasn't\njust\ntrying to find a job for a friend.\n\nSome legislative staffers saw a connection between Bradshaw's dismissal\nand\nopposition to McKay's tax plan by Sen. Debby Sanderson, R-Fort\nLauderdale.\nSanderson is the first Republican to publicly oppose McKay's plan and is\nchairwoman of the committee where Bradshaw worked.\n\n\"As God is my judge, it had absolutely nothing to do with this,\" McKay\nsaid,\nreferring to his tax plan.\n\nSanderson, visibly upset, said she doesn't know why Bradshaw was ousted,\nand\nlearned of it only five minutes before it happened when Krasovsky told\nher\nMcKay had \"lost confidence\" in Bradshaw.\n\nMcKay said he will try to help her find another state job.\n\nBradshaw has spent her entire career in state government working with\nFlorida election laws, first at the State Division of Elections, then in\nthe\nHouse and for the past five years in the Senate.\n\nThe Legislature has some of the state's best workers hidden away in\noffices\nwho frequently burn the midnight oil while lawmakers party and play and\nthen\nclaim the credit for the work.\n\nSome of these staffers make pretty good money and get things like free\ninsurance benefits and a coveted parking place inside the Capitol. But\nbelieve me, most of them earn it.\n\nA few of them can up and tell individual legislators when the train is\nrunning off the track, but many of them simply bow and say \"yes sir\"\nwhen\nthe lawmakers on their committees speak.\n\nLegislative staffers are almost never quoted in news stories. The golden\nrule of working in the Legislature is to quietly provide the technical\nbackground and let the lawmaker take the credit.\n\nBubbling beneath the surface of every day is the certain knowledge that\nthey\ncan be fired or moved for any reason any time. Maybe the speaker of the\nHouse or the Senate president doesn't like the color of their hair that\nday\nor the clothes they are wearing.\n\nOut they go.\n\nBradshaw sat through a routine meeting of the Elections Committee on her\nfinal day at work. A few hours later, she and her $75,000-a-year job\nwere\nhistory. She would not discuss it afterward, but friends hope she will\nfind\nanother state job.\n\nA lot of legislative staffers are suffering from dropped jaws and open\nmouths. They don't know why it happened. Bradshaw doesn't know why it\nhappened.\n\nWe are left to wonder what Bradshaw did to disturb the president's\nsleep.\nDid she fail to kiss the ring, or was McKay merely looking for a place\nto\nput a friend?","id":"20020112-C8BC3BBADF5DD5118A5C0004AC4CCAFC01908656@govexch.eog.state.fl.us","subject":"RE: Years of service, killed in a minute.

A client of mine, Labels for Literacy, is a program that is being introduced by the National Federation of the Blind.  Governor John Sununu is greatly involved in this program and I know that you and your family have been great supporters of LITERACY.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabels for Literacy, a project of the American Action Fund for Blind Children and Adults is being supported and promoted by the National Federation of the Blind. The program is aimed at placing Braille and large print labels on standard consumer products and will prompt the sighted population to “open their eyes” to the facts about the inaccessibility of information available to the blind and visually impaired. This lack of access to information is problematic in its own right, and is also largely responsible for the devastatingly low literacy rate among blind children. As you probably know, since 1963 the percentage of legally blind using Braille as their primary reading medium has dropped from 51 percent to a staggering ten percent.\n\nThis is not due to the lack of learning potential among blind children. The NFB attributes the drop in literacy rates among blind children to the lack of resources and Braille materials available to them. With the advent of audio technology, many children and adults use audio apes in place of books. Although this is a viable medium, “Listening is not literacy. There is not enough Braille available to children,” said Dr. Maurer, Presidentof the NFB. “There is a shortage of Braille in books and in mainstream media. ”Without available resources, blind children are denied access to information, and the results of this represent a problem that impacts society as a whole. With national initiatives toward equal opportunity, there is also need for this equal opportunity in information access and equal opportunity for America’s blind children to learn to read.\" \n\nOne primary reason that Braille has not been more prevalent thus far is the lack of an efficient technology to produce it. Until now, Braille has been produced by embossing paper or punching indentations onto asheet of paper. The traditional form of Braille is highly susceptible to damage from moisture and pressure, and is a slow and costly process.  A South Florida-based company, TechnologyTree International, has developed a revolutionary new technology that has the ability to produce a more durable Braille at higher speeds and with greater versatility. By utilizing a patented clear epoxy that is printed directly on apage by large commercial presses, the opportunity for the NFB to achieve its goal of having Braille on everything from children’s books to consumers packaged goods in now closer to reality.\n\nBy working closely with Technology Tree International, Daymon Associates Inc., an international food sales and marketing company, national consumer packaged goods companies, and the retail grocery industry, Labels for Literacy will provides self-adhesive sheets of Braille and large print labels to the blind and visually impaired. These labels will allow visually impaired and blind consumers to identify the products they purchase the same way a sighted consumer does…by reading them.  Collectively, the participating consumer packages goods companies and retail grocers are taking the initiative to provide equal access to information for all consumers that purchase their products. Labels for Literacy’s large print and Braille labels will be distributed free through multiple channels, as well as directly to consumers to use in their homes.    \n                \n“We believe there should be equal opportunity in advertising and labeling for all Americans. Visually impaired, blind and sighted persons should have the same information available to them,” said William Kelly, president and CEO of Technology Tree International.  According to Kelly, not only is the technology cost-effective in comparison to the traditionally embossed Braille, there are also benefits in placing the transparent Braille directly on top of printed text. \"This program will aid sighted parents and teachers as they read along in their efforts to teach blind children to read Braille.  To aid in this effort to teach and to understand Braille, we must make more of it available, more Braille in front of kids, more Braille within reach of children sitting at the breakfast table, more Braille on the packages that children pay attention to,”  added Kelly.\n\nThis technology opens up the potential for Braille to appear on more mainstream media than ever before – more textbooks, more novels, more public information materials. Further it will introduce a vehicle that will allow companies to market and communicate with the blind and visually impaired as they do now with sighted consumer. “The NFB wants these labels to be available to every blind person who would like them,” said Dr. Maurer.\n\nI would appreciate your feedback regarding this program and would be pleased to provide you (and others) with additional information and samples.  \n\nThanks and best regards,\nSandy Halperin","id":"20020112-80A58B5A0122D411BAFD0008C786508801A111AD@laspbs02.laspbs.state.fl.us","subject":"FW: Sandy Halperin - Labels for Literacy Program","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T11:13:50-06:00"},{"from":"\"Shanahan, Kathleen\" <kathleen.shanahan@myflorida.com>","to":"\"'jeb@jeb.org'\" <jeb@jeb.org>","date":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 12:27:05 -0500","message":"Gov - do you want to suggest we send LG to this reading prep school/academy?\nmight be just good to have him go? or should we send horn?\n\nBrian/Greg - we need to discuss one EOG sr level point person on reading -\nby cob monday.\n\nkathleen\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Openshaw, Mary Laura [mailto:OPENSHM@mail.doe.state.fl.us]\nSent: Saturday, January 12, 2002 12:17 PM\nTo: 'Shanahan, Kathleen'\nCc: McKeown, Georgia; Horne, Jim\nSubject: RE: list to Rod Paige by today\n\n\nGeorgia should know something by tomorrow about other dates.\n\nThe list calls for a Leadership team, so here are some suggestions based on\nthe categories in the letter:\n\nGovernor\nSecretary and/or Commissioner\nBrian Yablonski/Greg Turbeville -- whichever one will be devoting 50% of\ntime to Reading\nMary Laura Openshaw\nthe two program people who will be in reading office\nTom Fisher\nGerry Richardson\nJim Warford (Marion Supt) or other superintendent\nMarilyn Sharp (Executive Board Member of the Florida Reading Alliance)\n\nmlo\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Shanahan, Kathleen [mailto:kathleen.shanahan@myflorida.com]\nSent: Saturday, January 12, 2002 11:59 AM\nTo: Openshaw, Mary Laura; Shanahan, Kathleen\nCc: McKeown, Georgia; Horne, Jim\nSubject: RE: list to Rod Paige by today\n\n\nwhat are other week options?\nwhat are suggested names - gov would like to see before submitted?\nnot sure how we can send in a plan with out the official guideline from\nUSDOE?\ngov understands new timeline might be mid march but wants to understand\ndefinitely why/what is set?\n\nkahtleen\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Openshaw, Mary Laura [mailto:OPENSHM@mail.doe.state.fl.us]\nSent: Friday, January 11, 2002 6:31 PM\nTo: 'Shanahan, Kathleen'\nCc: McKeown, Georgia; Horne, Jim\nSubject: RE: list to Rod Paige by today\n\n\nI already bought us until Monday with USDOE.\n\nHere is what I know:\nGeorgia says that Lynda Davis can get Florida another week.

Some one told me that you passed a bill earlier this year \nfor payment to state employees who adopted children that were in state \ncustody.  Is this true?  If it is, does this only apply to state employees \nwho are paid by the state, or does it also apply to state employees that are \npaid through their county, but are in the Florida Retirement System?  The \nreason I'm inquiring is that I am a state employee, but county funded until \nthe state takes over all of our positions within the next couple of years. \nI have 15 years with the Florida Retirement System, 9 of those years being \nwith the 10th Judicial Circuit here in Bartow.  My husband and I just \nadopted my 3rd cousin, who has been under protective services, termination \nof rights and subsequent adoption since she was 3 months old. Had we not \ntaken custody well over 2 years ago, she would have went into foster care, \nas there was no suitable immediate family placement for Ivy.  I have never \nregreted a day that we have spent with Ivy, or a penny that we have spent on \nher.  I would do it all over again.  I would very much appreciate a response \nto this inquiry.

Peterson \n\n\n    As Americans, we should have been astounded by the recent findings that federal officials intentionally planted hair from the threatened Canadian lynx in our national forests in order to impose sweeping land management regulations. We should have been shocked at the audacity of government employees to falsify evidence in order to advance their environmental agenda, and even more perplexed at the lackluster response from their respective agencies when the transgressions were brought to light. \n\n\n    But in truth, many of us who come from rural America have grown accustomed to environmental activism prevailing over the rule of law and over the best interests of families and communities. Time and time again, we have witnessed the federal government run roughshod over rural America because the Washington elite thought they knew better than the regular folks who tilled the soil, ran the cattle, or enjoyed their favorite campsite or trail. And, if a faulty study or falsified evidence has been necessary in order to enact radical environmental policies, government bureaucrats have had a green light for the past eight years because of the ends-justifies-the-means rationalization that became common practice during the Clinton administration. \n\n\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20020107-89178288.htm\n\n\nContent-Transfer-Encoding:

Bob Sump, Republican co-chairman of the Natural Resources Committee. \n\n\n    If such a sample had been given, it could have tainted a grizzly habitat study in Washington that encompasses 3,600

\n\n\n    Federal agencies are teaming up for a joint investigation to determine why government employees planted evidence of a threatened species in national forests. \n                              \n    The fraudulent samples of lynx hair were submitted by five federal and two Washington state employees for laboratory analysis. One of the workers notified his supervisor of the false sampling, and the Forest Service investigated and disciplined the employees. Two other federal employees who worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService also were disciplined. \n\n\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20020103-13648024.htm \n  \n\n\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR \nJanuary 3, 2002 \n  \n\n\nEnviornmentalists endanger species — homo sapiens \n\n\n    While I appreciate your justified outrage at the revelation that lynx hairs were planted in national forests in Washington state, we must ask if this is just the tip of the environmental science iceberg (\"The mysterious missing lynx,\" Editorials, Dec. 31). \n                                 \n    This past summer, thousands of farmers and ranchers in southern Oregon and Northern California were denied water predicated upon two biological opinions concerning the short nose sucker and the coho salmon. During a \npublic meeting prior to the water cutoff, I asked the local manager of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service three questions: \"How many suckers were in Upper Klamath Lake in 1906?\" (the year the Bureau of Reclamation began operating the Klamath Project); \"How many suckers were in the lake in 1988, at the time they were declared endangered?\"; and \"How many suckers will have to be in the lake in order to be delisted?\" The response to all three questions was, \"We don't know.\" \n                                 \n    It appears that we will continue to have economic train wrecks all over the rural areas of this country until Congress understands that the Endangered Species Act in its present form is a license to steal and destroy the livelihoods of this country's most loyal citizens. In response to Idaho Republican Sen. Larry E. Craig's statement, \"If they [the fraud´s perpetrators] hadn't been caught, you might have seen entire forests shut down on a false premise,\" and Utah Republican Rep. James V. Hansen's comments that \"this hoax could have wrecked some people's way of life,\" I wish to point out that an agricultural basin has been shut down and that federal action has wrecked many people's lives. And for what? I don't know. \n                                 \nJOHN ELLIOTT \nKlamath County commissioner \nKlamath Falls, Ore. \n                                 \n• \n    In your Dec. 31 editorial, \"The mysterious missing lynx,\" you condemn the fraud perpetrated by environmentalist activists working for the government, quoting Idaho Republican Sen. Larry E. Craig: \"If [the fraud´s perpetrators] hadn't been caught, you might have seen entire forests shut down on a false premise.\" \n                                 \n    However, if the evidence that an \"endangered species\" inhabited the forest had been real, would the entire forest have been shut down on a \"true premise\"? The fraud is worse than planting phony evidence — it's planting phony principles. \n\n\nThe Endangered Species Act (ESA) puts \"nature\" above human rights as a matter of law and, in accord with the environmentalism's inherent nature worship, as a matter of ethics. Its history is one of coercion and corruption of science in the service of biocentrism. \n                                 \n    ESA expired years ago and has been too controversial to be renewed by Congress. Yet Congress, morally and politically intimidated by the environmentalist lobby, continues to fund its implementation. \n\n\n    It's time to kill ESA.

Norton yesterday called for an inspector general to investigate why federal biologists planted false evidence of a rare wildcat in two national forests. \n  \n    \"I am deeply troubled by allegations that Fish and Wildlife Service employees, along with employees from other federal and state agencies, deliberately submitted false samples to the laboratory analyzing data for the Canada lynx survey program,\" Mrs. Norton said. \n\n\nhttp://washingtontimes.com/national/20011220-859622.htm \n\n\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR \nDecember 20, 2001 \n  \n\n\n                           When ends justify means \n\n\n                                Your Dec. 17 story by Audrey Hudson, \"Rare lynx hairs found in forests \n                           exposed as hoax,\" performed a genuine service to all Americans. \n                                For years, radical environmentalists, some in government employment, have \n                           skewed and falsified data in scientific studies to achieve political goals, and no \n                           one was the wiser. Your story certainly lifted the rock and let the sun shine on \n                           that subject. \n                                However, you could have served the public even better by digging further \n                           into the motives of those planting false environmental evidence. \n                                Listening to those on the receiving end of environmental regulations, you \n                           likely would hear that the motives include the shutdown of virtually every \n                           human enterprise and the removal of all human presence from rural areas all \n                           over the nation, not just in the West. \n                                You probably would discover that any hardworking local making such \n                           outlandish accusations inevitably faces an overwhelming outcry of \"conspiracy \n                           theory\" or \"paranoia.\" \n                                You could clarify the subject greatly by reporting on the individuals who \n                           perpetrated this lynx hoax. What did they have in mind? \n                                It might reveal that some conspiracy theories actually reveal conspiracies \n                           and that even if you are paranoid, someone may actually be out to get you. \n                                 \n                                RON ARNOLD \n                                Executive vice president \n                                Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise \n                                Bellevue, Wash. \n  \n  \n\n\n                           Hold federal agencies to a higher standard \n\n\n                                It comes as no surprise to read that federal and state wildlife biologists have \n                           been discovered planting false evidence of the Canadian lynx on National \n                           Forest System lands in Washington state (\"Rare lynx hairs found in forests \n                           exposed as hoax,\" Dec. 17). Locals long familiar with the area told the \n                           \"experts\" that lynx did not inhabit the area, but such evidence apparently is \n                           ignored by a new breed of biologists who know better. \n                                Those of us in the land-use arena have known that oftentimes green groups \n                           will say or do anything to enact their agenda. That is their right. However, \n                           when federal agencies adopt that same credo, it casts a long shadow of doubt \n                           on their land-use-planning efforts, whether those efforts are underpinned by \n                           sound science or are policy-driven. \n                                Events such as this lynx fiasco make it easy to become cynical about the \n                           whole process, and that is sad, given the importance of the agencies' mission. \n                           The blurring of no-holds-barred advocacy and management has politicized the \n                           process and is making it more difficult for agencies to take necessary actions \n                           to manage human activity and protect the environment. \n                                For the past eight years, federal agencies have asked the American people to \n                           take precious time out of their busy schedules to attend a plethora of public \n                           meetings on large land-use-planning efforts. These efforts have as their \n                           foundation the protection of threatened and endangered species. \n                                Millions of taxpayer dollars have been redirected from important recreation \n                           and resource programs at the Department of Interior or the U.S. Forest Service \n                           to fund these endless planning efforts. Some of us said these programs had no \n                           built-in safeguards to protect our access to federal lands by unscrupulous or \n                           agenda-driven agency biologists. We were told not to worry. \n                                Elected officials and agency leadership must demonstrate a zero-tolerance \n                           policy for behavior like that in this lynx issue. On too many occasions, agency \n                           personnel caught misusing appropriated tax monies to enact the anti-access \n                           agenda of the environmental movement have avoided public accountability for \n                           their actions. The American public and the mission deserve more. \n                                I once heard a popular green proverb that said, \"Our agenda is so important \n                           that we have to lie.\" Though that philosophy may be understandable for some \n                           groups, I hope our nation and elected officials will hold the federal land \n                           agencies to a higher standard. \n                                 \n                                DON AMADOR \n                                Oakley, Calif. \n\n\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20011220-3705892.htm#4 \n\n\nNOTE: In accordance with Title 17 U.S.C. section 107, any copyrighted material  herein is distributed without profit or payment to those who have expressed  a  prior interest in receiving this information for non-profit research and  educational purposes only.

The inmates will continue to do road work, but will live in larger prisons.\n\n\t*       Consolidation of  Road Prisons: \n\n\n\tThe Governor will recommend a reduction of 50 positions and 2.4 million dollars in trust funding  to consolidate three road-prison populations back into larger prison facilities. The inmates assigned to work squads will continue to work on road projects.  This recommendation is necessary as current trust fund receipts can no longer sustain current road-prison operations.  It is more cost effective to house the 50-60 inmates who live in road prisons in larger prisons, because the Department can absorb the inmates with minimal cost. Maintaining separate road prisons requires additional staff and operational expenses that can be avoided through consolidations. Affected road prisons are Tallahassee, Arcadia and Loxahatchee.","id":"20020112-80A58B5A0122D411BAFD0008C786508801A359FC@laspbs02.laspbs.state.fl.us","subject":"Road prison issue","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T11:47:28-06:00"},{"from":"apontemb@juno.com","to":"jeb@jeb.org","date":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 12:50:34 -0500","message":"Jeb:\n \nI am concerned that the providers continue to be in control of many things.  e.g. CAFE conference is planned by the Florida Association of Rehabilitation Facilities (FARF).

I wonder if you may have another e-mail address for your \"friends\" that is not subject to public disclosure. as your most recent e-mails indicate.\n \nI know that you are fully aware of the situation with VR and OAOC.  I do not know if you recall my communications to you about the subject several years ago.  Many of my concerns then and now, are some of those expressed in the OPPAGA report.  You do not need a rocket science to see that the composition of the OAOC commissioners were a clear conflict of interest with VR goals.  They  represent the providers, and not the consumers interest.  Besides, by federal mandate, VR already has a body with the Florida Rehabilitation Board.  I often wonder what exactly that board does.  Why do we need two boards? One board with consumers, and employers representation is what we need to have.\n \nFrom a consumer perspective, I do not see that VR is any better than it was with all of the changes.  It was bad before, and it's bad now.  Carl Miller has the right philosophy, approach, and understanding of the issues, but he seems to be caught between the board and the commission, and  ineffective VR workers that continue to boycott any attempt to change the system, refusing Carl's directives, and continuously violating the peoples rights.  In other words, a MESS that is hard to fix.\n \nI do want to let you know that I support, and trust Carl Miller intention and judgement.  We (the state) needs to make sure that before any changes are implemented that you have an infrastructure in place.  You do not want to substitute the current mess with another mess like the one that DDPO has.\n \nGod bless you, and give you the strengths and the vision to do what is best for all.\n \nCariños,\n \nBerthy\n==========================\nPublished Wednesday, January 9, 2002 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivatization panel ripped for high costs, poor service\n\ncmarbin@herald.com \n\n\nState auditors are urging lawmakers to disband the commission created to shepherd one of Florida's first efforts to privatize a governmental service, saying the project increased costs and offered dramatically poorer services. \n\n\nThe auditors, in the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, say in a draft report that services to disabled Floridians seeking employment have worsened since the state's vocational rehabilitation program was taken over two years ago by a panel charged with shifting to private management. \n\n\nThe program's primary focus is finding jobs for 100,000 physically and mentally disabled Floridians so they can live independently. \n\n\n``We believe it would not be sound public policy to continue the commission in its present form,'' the agency, called OPPAGA, wrote in the report released late Monday. The report, portions of which were leaked to reporters and advocates in recent weeks, comes at a critical time, though its recommendations are nonbinding. \n\n\nThe panel, called the Occupational Access and Opportunity Commission, has indicated in recent weeks it plans to move forward with privatization, regardless of recent audits and reports suggesting the shift hasn't benefited disabled Floridians or taxpayers. Only the Legislature can dismantle the commission. \n\n\nIn fact, on Friday the commission will discuss plans to move ahead with the shift to private management in much of the state. So far, services have been privatized in 10 counties -- four rural North Florida counties, Bradford and Alachua, and the Treasure Coast counties of Indian River, Martin, Okeechobee and St. Lucie. \n\n\nGov. Jeb Bush said Tuesday he is waiting to learn more about the audit's findings before deciding whether he will take any action. He said he has requested a briefing next week from education department leaders.\n\n\n\nAWAITING A RESPONSE \n\n\nFlorida Education Commissioner Charlie Crist, whose agency oversees Florida's $125 million vocational rehabilitation effort, said he is awaiting a response to the report from Carl Miller, who manages the program. \n\n\n``It's disturbing to me,'' Crist said of the audit. ``I don't want to pass any judgment on this thing. . . . But what I see in the report is disturbing. . . . Clients are not being served well -- and maybe not taxpayers.'' \n\n\nOAOC Chairman Dennis Celorie of Sarasota said he will lobby at Friday's meeting for giving the 16-member commission another year to solve its problems and launch a more well-reasoned shift toward private management. ``I think the commission can handle what's going on,'' he said. \n\n\nAuditors said the privatization effort, though well-intended, has fared badly because the commission charged with its implementation planned and managed the transition poorly. \n\n\nIndeed, the agency that controls Florida's $100 million in federal vocational rehab dollars has labeled Florida the only state at ``high risk'' of losing its federal funding -- two years in a row. \n\n\n``If it had been properly planned as intended by the Legislature and more carefully managed, the effort could have served as a model for other states and may have been more favorably received by the federal government,'' auditors wrote. ``Although required to do so by state law, the commission did not develop a five-year plan for the program.'' \n\n\nPrivate providers were given large start-up costs to develop their programs, though the OAOC never required the businesses to document or justify those awards, the auditors reported. \n\n\nMoreover, the commission never developed a formula for measuring whether the private providers were doing better work, for less money, than their counterparts in state government, the report states. \n\n\n``The net effect of these contracting problems is that service costs substantially increased in the three demonstration regions, while accountability for program funds substantially decreased,'' the report concluded. \n\n\nFor clients of the agency, the transition has led to problems, as well. Fewer disabled Floridians have been screened for eligibility for services in the last two years, the report says, and such determinations are ``projected to fall significantly in the 2001-2002 fiscal year.'' The number of clients matched with jobs fell as well. \n\n\nAs the OAOC pushed ``aggressively'' toward private management, they gave public counselors the distinct message their services were no longer wanted, the report says, though the original intent of lawmakers was to offer disabled Floridians a choice between public and private counselors.\n\n\n\nMASSIVE TURNOVER \n\n\nAs a result, turnover among public counselors reached unprecedented levels, forcing clients to seek new case managers often. In the fiscal year 1999-2000, for example, 28 percent of the program's counselors left. The next year, according to the report, 19 percent quit. \n\n\nIrwin M. Kaplan, a Pompano Beach man with physical and emotional disabilities, went through three counselors in less than two years, he told The Herald. \n\n\n``A worker who might have had 60 cases ends up with 150 cases,'' Kaplan lamented. ``Clients get lost in the shuffle. It slows things down.'' \n\n\nMarvin Rosenblatt, a Broward psychologist who has worked with Kaplan, said the disruptions proved particularly taxing for Kaplan, who suffers from extreme anxiety that was exacerbated by the uncertainly over his care. \n\n\n``He had a medical problem requiring surgery,'' Rosenblatt said. ``His counselor had assured him he would get this help. But a new counselor came in and had to go through a series of steps to determine whether or not this would be done. He was afraid he might lose his job.'' \n\n\nThe report was a sort of vindication for OAOC Commissioner Warren Jernigan, a disabled Pensacola man who for years had urged the board to move cautiously. Jernigan voted against proceeding with new private contracts. \n\n\n``We've got to slow down so that we make sure we capture the data necessary to justify our decisions,'' Jernigan said Tuesday after reviewing the draft report. ``My concern is for the disabled, and for the future of this program.'' \n\n\nHerald staff writer Joni James contributed to this report.","id":"20020112-20020112.125038.-1712309.3.AponteMB@juno.com","subject":"VR - OAOC","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T11:50:34-06:00"},{"from":"Sid Dinerstein <siddinerstein@yahoo.com>","to":"jeb bush <jeb@jeb.org>","date":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 10:00:52 -0800 (PST)","message":"Dear Governor Bush:\n\nAs the Vice Chairman of the Republican Party of Palm\nBeach County I want to thank you for the School Board\nappointment of Ed Garcia.

I am very concerned regarding the Med Waiver DS services directory.  I think it is a violation of the Prado Steiman agreement and a violation of the Olmstead Supreme court decision and the Executive Order signed by President Bush for the swift implementation of the Olmstead decision.  I think we are taking giant steps backwards to the way things used to be, continuing to condemn persons with developmental disabilities in Florida to segregation, dependency and isolation, keeping them away from being able to access life and society.  I am also deeply concerned regarding the way some providers are violating the law and violating the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities, especially in the area of supported employment, and are able to get away with it.  The Department, at least in my district, is not concerned with the rights of individuals with disabilities and participate in the discrimination and violation of the rights of these individuals.  In Florida, individuals with developmental disabilities have no access to protection or to advocacy.  The only agency that is mandated to provide such protection and advocacy does a very poor job and in my opinion is a worthless agency and a parasite in our society.  In my opinion, this agency should be defunded. Florida will be better off setting aside legal advocacy funds to be provided directly to the individuals that need it so that they can go and buy their own legal representation whenever they need it.  Children with disabilities and their families have no access to the legal system because of lack of access to legal representation.\n\nI am unable to attend the rule development workshop in Tallahassee for two reasons:  1) I just learned about the workshop and 2) I have no funds to leave my home and travel to Tallahassee.  Please let me know what I can do to offer comments and to participate in the rule development process.  It seems that Tallahassee forgets that there is more to Florida, much more, than just Tallahassee.  \n\nI will await further information for my participation and my son's participation in this important process.\n\nLilliam Rangel-Diaz and Juan O.

Lee\nWilson is a preeminent water allocation expert, and has represented both\nupstream and downstream interests under much larger compacts in other parts\nof the country.  He has independently confirmed what I advised you of some\nweeks ago: that we have reached the point where we can actually better\nprotect Florida's interests through administrative appeals and, if\nnecessary, litigation than we are by conceding any more of our water\ninterests.\n\nThe Nature Conservancy (the lead national environmental group on this\nissues) as well as the more local environmental interests will fully and\npublicly support Florida's decision to allow the compact to expire.  Indeed,\nI do not believe any Florida constituents will be disappointed.\n\nIf you happen to be told that Georgia has \"given\" Florida all (or much) of\nour requested stateline flow numbers, please be aware of the fact that at\nthe same time, Georgia has substantially changed the \"trigger\" for releasing\nthose flows.  Releases of water to Florida is driven, in part, on the\n\"composite storage\" (i.e. cumulative amount of water) being held in two\nreservoirs.  The composite storage is measured in \"zones\" (Zone 1 is the\nfullest, Zone 4 is the least full).\n\nWhile Georgia has moved closer to our needed flows, they have redefined Zone\n4 half way into Zone 3.  While it allows Georgia to point to a table and say\nthey are meeting Florida's numbers, the redefined release triggers in fact\nkeeps much of that water unavailable.\n\nThere are a number of other similar types of problems that continue to\nfrustrate our ability to achieve a fair compromise.  I believe we have\nreached the point where we will be better served (even with the uncertainty,\ndelay and substantial cost) by having a judge or court-appointed special\nmaster arbitrate these issues.\n\nCall me, of course, if you wish to discuss further.

I wonder if you may have another e-mail address for your \"friends\" that is not subject to public disclosure. as your most recent e-mails indicate.\n \nI know that you are fully aware of the situation with VR and OAOC.  I do not know if you recall my communications to you about the subject several years ago.  Many of my concerns then and now, are some of those expressed in the OPPAGA report.  You do not need a rocket science to see that the composition of the OAOC commissioners were a clear conflict of interest with VR goals.  They  represent the providers, and not the consumers interest.  Besides, by federal mandate, VR already has a body with the Florida Rehabilitation Board.  I often wonder what exactly that board does.  Why do we need two boards? One board with consumers, and employers representation is what we need to have.\n \nFrom a consumer perspective, I do not see that VR is any better than it was with all of the changes.  It was bad before, and it's bad now.  Carl Miller has the right philosophy, approach, and understanding of the issues, but he seems to be caught between the board and the commission, and  ineffective VR workers that continue to boycott any attempt to change the system, refusing Carl's directives, and continuously violating the peoples rights.  In other words, a MESS that is hard to fix.\n \nI do want to let you know that I support, and trust Carl Miller intention and judgement.  We (the state) needs to make sure that before any changes are implemented that you have an infrastructure in place.  You do not want to substitute the current mess with another mess like the one that DDPO has.\n \nGod bless you, and give you the strengths and the vision to do what is best for all.\n \nCariños,\n \nBerthy\n==========================\nPublished Wednesday, January 9, 2002 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivatization panel ripped for high costs, poor service\n\ncmarbin@herald.com \n\n\nState auditors are urging lawmakers to disband the commission created to shepherd one of Florida's first efforts to privatize a governmental service, saying the project increased costs and offered dramatically poorer services. \n\n\nThe auditors, in the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, say in a draft report that services to disabled Floridians seeking employment have worsened since the state's vocational rehabilitation program was taken over two years ago by a panel charged with shifting to private management. \n\n\nThe program's primary focus is finding jobs for 100,000 physically and mentally disabled Floridians so they can live independently. \n\n\n``We believe it would not be sound public policy to continue the commission in its present form,'' the agency, called OPPAGA, wrote in the report released late Monday. The report, portions of which were leaked to reporters and advocates in recent weeks, comes at a critical time, though its recommendations are nonbinding. \n\n\nThe panel, called the Occupational Access and Opportunity Commission, has indicated in recent weeks it plans to move forward with privatization, regardless of recent audits and reports suggesting the shift hasn't benefited disabled Floridians or taxpayers. Only the Legislature can dismantle the commission. \n\n\nIn fact, on Friday the commission will discuss plans to move ahead with the shift to private management in much of the state. So far, services have been privatized in 10 counties -- four rural North Florida counties, Bradford and Alachua, and the Treasure Coast counties of Indian River, Martin, Okeechobee and St. Lucie. \n\n\nGov. Jeb Bush said Tuesday he is waiting to learn more about the audit's findings before deciding whether he will take any action. He said he has requested a briefing next week from education department leaders.\n\n\n\nAWAITING A RESPONSE \n\n\nFlorida Education Commissioner Charlie Crist, whose agency oversees Florida's $125 million vocational rehabilitation effort, said he is awaiting a response to the report from Carl Miller, who manages the program. \n\n\n``It's disturbing to me,'' Crist said of the audit. ``I don't want to pass any judgment on this thing. . . . But what I see in the report is disturbing. . . . Clients are not being served well -- and maybe not taxpayers.'' \n\n\nOAOC Chairman Dennis Celorie of Sarasota said he will lobby at Friday's meeting for giving the 16-member commission another year to solve its problems and launch a more well-reasoned shift toward private management. ``I think the commission can handle what's going on,'' he said. \n\n\nAuditors said the privatization effort, though well-intended, has fared badly because the commission charged with its implementation planned and managed the transition poorly. \n\n\nIndeed, the agency that controls Florida's $100 million in federal vocational rehab dollars has labeled Florida the only state at ``high risk'' of losing its federal funding -- two years in a row. \n\n\n``If it had been properly planned as intended by the Legislature and more carefully managed, the effort could have served as a model for other states and may have been more favorably received by the federal government,'' auditors wrote. ``Although required to do so by state law, the commission did not develop a five-year plan for the program.'' \n\n\nPrivate providers were given large start-up costs to develop their programs, though the OAOC never required the businesses to document or justify those awards, the auditors reported. \n\n\nMoreover, the commission never developed a formula for measuring whether the private providers were doing better work, for less money, than their counterparts in state government, the report states. \n\n\n``The net effect of these contracting problems is that service costs substantially increased in the three demonstration regions, while accountability for program funds substantially decreased,'' the report concluded. \n\n\nFor clients of the agency, the transition has led to problems, as well. Fewer disabled Floridians have been screened for eligibility for services in the last two years, the report says, and such determinations are ``projected to fall significantly in the 2001-2002 fiscal year.'' The number of clients matched with jobs fell as well. \n\n\nAs the OAOC pushed ``aggressively'' toward private management, they gave public counselors the distinct message their services were no longer wanted, the report says, though the original intent of lawmakers was to offer disabled Floridians a choice between public and private counselors.\n\n\n\nMASSIVE TURNOVER \n\n\nAs a result, turnover among public counselors reached unprecedented levels, forcing clients to seek new case managers often. In the fiscal year 1999-2000, for example, 28 percent of the program's counselors left. The next year, according to the report, 19 percent quit. \n\n\nIrwin M. Kaplan, a Pompano Beach man with physical and emotional disabilities, went through three counselors in less than two years, he told The Herald. \n\n\n``A worker who might have had 60 cases ends up with 150 cases,'' Kaplan lamented. ``Clients get lost in the shuffle. It slows things down.'' \n\n\nMarvin Rosenblatt, a Broward psychologist who has worked with Kaplan, said the disruptions proved particularly taxing for Kaplan, who suffers from extreme anxiety that was exacerbated by the uncertainly over his care. \n\n\n``He had a medical problem requiring surgery,'' Rosenblatt said. ``His counselor had assured him he would get this help. But a new counselor came in and had to go through a series of steps to determine whether or not this would be done. He was afraid he might lose his job.'' \n\n\nThe report was a sort of vindication for OAOC Commissioner Warren Jernigan, a disabled Pensacola man who for years had urged the board to move cautiously. Jernigan voted against proceeding with new private contracts. \n\n\n``We've got to slow down so that we make sure we capture the data necessary to justify our decisions,'' Jernigan said Tuesday after reviewing the draft report. ``My concern is for the disabled, and for the future of this program.'' \n\n\nHerald staff writer Joni James contributed to this report.","id":"20020112-E43F6E09953F9D4BA2A77F4B243A4ED0010E236B@exch2000.jeb.org","subject":"RE: VR - OAOC fop","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T13:36:22-06:00"},{"from":"\"Jeb Bush\" <MAILER-DAEMON>","to":"'Sid Dinerstein'","date":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 20:34:08 +0000","message":"thank you Sid.\n\nJeb Bush \n\n***********************************************************\nPlease note: Florida has a very broad public records law.\nMost written communications to or from state officials\nregarding state business are public records available to the\npublic and media upon request.

Hope your having a good day, but it\nlooks like I have to throw a kink into things.  I have been approached by\nseveral Support Coordinators in District 1 that they are being told by the\nDS office (specifically by a Miss Leslie Petty, whom I have spoke with on\nthe phone before and she had a very belligerent attitude toward me on the\nphone, she even told me she had heard about me an what a trouble maker I\nwas, my reply to her was that I only make trouble when the life of a client\nas been placed at risk and as chairman of the Family Care Council that is\npart of my job, when reported this to her superior they just shrugged their\nshoulders).  Don't mean to picky but I'm not used to being talked to that\nway by a state employee.  Ok sorry I've blown off my steam, now let me get\nback to the problem.  The Coordinators are all being told by her they will\nhave to redo all of the FSTS (Florida Status Tracking Survey) and that\neveryone's rating will have to be reduced for no other reason than to save\nmoney.  Sir we were told that they would not be cutting services until the\nanniversery of each clients cost plans and the went up for review,  but\nthey are not waiting for that, they have started cutting services right and\nleft from clients that have already been approved and are placing a large\nmajority of them at risk, as I pointed out with Danz Pettis whom I wrote\nyou about.  The FSTS is a very poor tool to be using anyhow it does not\naddress mental or degrees of mental retardation at all it mainly wants to\nknow if a person is severely physically disabled enough to be wheelchair\nbound or if they are mentally unstable enough to try and take their own\nlife, sir a person can be severely disabled without being wheel chair\nbound.  This tool for determining their rating needs to be severely\noverhauled to reflect a persons true problems.  And unfortunately with all\nthese cuts in services I am afraid that all the small providers like the\nAbilities Center of North West Florida are going to have to shut their\ndoors because they will not be able to stay open with their clients loosing\ntheir services.  To me the smaller agencies provide a much higher quality\nof service than the huge mega centers that are out to make money more that\nthey are concerned about the quality of care that the clients are\nreceiving.  Sorry to be so long winded again but you seem to be the only\none that listens.  Thank you again sir.  Your friend always Darrel Walker.","id":"20020112-311EC6B4B5614744B91D69784B12250B287A59@exch2000.jeb.org","subject":"RE: FW: FSTS fup","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T17:17:23-06:00"},{"from":"\"Jeb Bush\" <MAILER-DAEMON>","to":"'Julie Young'","date":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 23:19:20 +0000","message":"Thank you Julie for your strong recommendation.\n\nJeb Bush \n\n***********************************************************\nPlease note: Florida has a very broad public records law.\nMost written communications to or from state officials\nregarding state business are public records available to the\npublic and media upon request.

It has been my pleasure and distinct\n learning opportunity to work with Todd and his company over the past year\n and a half. Through his acute business acumen and leadership skills,\n coupled with a strong sense of contribution, Todd has assisted greatly in\n Florida Virtual School?s successes. Todd?s ability to operate in the fast\n paced business-to-business environment, yet communicate and do well within\n the very different education and government culture, is a true glimpse of\n his leadership ability.\n\n In our partnership with Todd and Semtor Inc., he has clearly demonstrated\n that integrity and credibility are woven into his presence and I am\n confident that he will lend those qualities to the office of the Governor.\n He has built Semtor Inc, into a successful and growing technology company\n from the ground up, thus he also brings proven and practical technology\n start-up and staying power.\n\n Todd is an outstanding public speaker and represents himself with grace\n and style. He shows tremendous respect for the customer, is committed to\n excellence, fairness and the spirit of partnership. He has shown\n tremendous capacity for the industry, for dynamic innovation, and a\n sincere commitment to public education and the State of Florida.\n\n It is with privilege that I give my highest recommendation as a government\n employee and Florida citizen to Todd Jones. He would be an outstanding\n addition to your administration and a gift to this State. I would be most\n happy to provide any additional information regarding my observation and\n interaction with Todd.\n\n Respectfully,\n\n\n Julie E.

Although this preservation purchase of 2600 acres (the other 2600 acres will be handled as mitigation banks by the owners, the Hollands, I guess) will be accomplished without state help, I do wish to thank you and your staff again for your attentiveness and readiness to help back when I was so urgently contacting you for help---out of fear that lacking OC $$$ would mean this crucial piece of land would fall into the hands of developers!   It will NOT, I am so happy to report.  This really IS an important, pristine tract at the headwaters of the Econlocohatchee River, and because other preserved tracts are nearby and/or contiguous, a fairly large stretch of forest and wetlands and ecosystems will be allowed to flourish without undue intrusions by people and development. \nMy hope is that the state was made a little more aware of our plight here of rapidly disappearing greenspace and \"virgin\" forest (in comparison to other areas in Florida) and will keep us in mind too when new \"eco-funds\" become available! (I'm thrilled that the Everglades restoration will be in full swing soon, and grateful for your efforts on that!)\nI know you have your hands full---but just wanted to share with you this news of a likely bonny outcome for this preservation project, and to thank you for your sincere interest throughout.\n \nYours sincerely,\n \nRebecca Eagan","id":"20020112-311EC6B4B5614744B91D69784B12250B287A5A@exch2000.jeb.org","subject":"RE: Holland Ranch","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T17:21:09-06:00"},{"from":"\"Jeb Bush\" <MAILER-DAEMON>","to":"'AJlover4ever20@aol.com'","date":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 23:45:24 +0000","message":"Tina, it is great hearing from you.

Journalists\nacross the state recently received an e-mail from the League of the South\nexhorting them to mark Jan. 10 as \"Florida Freedom Day.\" On that date in\n1861, a not-very-democratic cadre of planters and other rich white folks got\ntogether in Tallahassee and voted to secede from the Union.\n\nWe all remember how well that worked out.\n\nIn his message, Steve Walker, \"Provisional Chairman\" of the Northeast\nFlorida League of the South, says it was \"an oppressive national government\"\nthat drove the state to \"declare her independence\" 141 years ago, and urges\nthe press to \"proclaim her day\" in headlines.\n\nIn case you've missed some of their other crusades (rallying for the\nConfederate battle flag, calling the renaming of a street for Rev. Martin\nLuther King a \"heritage violation,\" insisting the Civil War had nothing to\ndo with slavery) the League of the South is an organization advocating the\nre-secession of Southern states to form a \"Christian Republic\" where men are\nmen, women are ladies and black people are welcome as long as they don't get\nuppity. The league loathes multiculturalism, feminism, secularism and taxes\nof all kinds. You might note a number of similarities to far-right fringe of\nthe Florida Republican Party.\n\nProgressive Democratic governors such as LeRoy Collins, Reuben Askew and Bob\nGraham did much to lead the state out of the torpid and hateful days of Jim\nCrow, fighting for integration, fair courts, equal rights, access to quality\neducation and health care. But now for all its superficial New South patina,\nthe state is sliding back to its Old South ways.\n\nAt the secession convention of 1861, the rulers of Florida were obsessed\nwith states' rights: chiefly the \"right\" of one group of people to own\nanother group of people. Now what the rulers of Florida care most about is\nthe \"right\" of the affluent to pay as few taxes as possible, no matter who\nsuffers. It wasn't just the recession or the attacks of Sept. 11 that hurt\nthe state's economy, it's two years of tax cuts, sponsored by Gov. Jeb Bush\nand the Republican-controlled Legislature. In this failure of\nresponsibility, you could say that Florida has seceded from a commitment to\na just society.\n\nWe have seceded from decent education funding. In the recent budget-slashing\nfrenzy of two special sessions, our Republican-led government has zeroed-out\nmoney to recruit and retain new teachers. Florida used to want to compare\nitself to New York, Michigan, Massachusetts and California in the quality of\nits public education. Now we do worse than Georgia and North Carolina. And\nwe are losing teachers to better-paying jobs in Alabama.\n\nWe have seceded from a serious university system. By junking the Board of\nRegents in favor of politicized boards of trustees, we will have warring\ntribes competing for each pitiful higher education dollar. Tuition will go\nup, making it even harder for lower-income students to afford a four-year\ndegree.\n\nWe have seceded from responsibility for the poor and the old. The\nLegislature cut prenatal care to women who will never own stocks and bonds\nand so aren't too bothered by the intangibles tax -- now they just have to\nworry about bringing a healthy baby into the world. And 23,000 elderly\npeople will have to find a way to pay for their own prescription drugs\nbecause of the budget cuts. Many of them will just do without. This coming\nlegislative session, there's no telling what Florida will secede from. There\nare bills filed that will hamstring Florida's strong public records laws,\nallowing the government to close arrest records and keep many of its\noperations secret. There are legislators hell-bent on once again attacking\nFlorida's independent judiciary. They want judges appointed solely by the\ngovernor or elected in partisan races -- just like they were 30 or 40 years\nago when Florida's legal system was a disgraceful swamp of corruption and\ngraft.\n\nMaybe the biggest difference between the League of the South and the\nradicals running Florida is that the league at least understands and\nacknowledges that they want to return to a pre-modern society. Jeb Bush and\nTom Feeney (John McKay, the senate president, actually has ideas for tax\nreform, making him a bit of a freak in the party) seem convinced that they\nare taking Florida forward. But forward to what? Some kind of banana\nrepublic where the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and everybody who\ncan goes to college in Georgia?\n\nMaybe we should commemorate (though not celebrate) the day in 1861 the\nrulers of Florida chose to separate the state from the core American values\nof liberty and justice for all. Remembering our history might at least slow\ndown our repeating it.\n\n- Diane Roberts, a former Times editorial writer, is a professor of English\nat the University of Alabama.","id":"20020112-311EC6B4B5614744B91D69784B12250B287A61@exch2000.jeb.org","subject":"FW: Opinion: Florida sliding back to its Old South ways.

The National Guard Bureau\ndidn't\nnotice (it was done close to the holidays) and the news broke late this\nweek\nthat 70 Guardsmen in Florida would be let go (43 from the ports; the\nothers\nfrom intelligence analysis support and other headquarters type\nfunctions.\n\n        Newspapers and TV stations have been calling today about it.\n\n        Senator Graham's office called me about it today, and,\nindirectly,\nSenator Nelson's.\n\n        The Florida Guard has raised the issue, and their initial\nrequest to\nme was to have you reach either the President or the SECDEF about it.  I\nthink that is an option, but way low down on the priority of options.\n\n        Therefore, the way out, I think is as follows:\n\n                To the press:  I have been responding that 1) The\nGuardsmen\nare an important part of your counterdrug strategy.  They do good work,\nand\nFlorida's ports lead the nations in interdictions (we get 2/3 rds of the\nnational port take, by numbers of seizures and by amounts of seizures).\nWe,\ntherefore, are working with Washington to find a way to keep our\nGuardsmen\non the job.\n\n                To the National Guard:  This is a National Guard Bureau\nissue.  The national level should lead in the effort to correct what at\nbest\nwas an oversight (they should have been watching).\n\n                The state of Florida:  Florida needs 2.5M to keep those\n70\nat work the rest of the year.  We should go after 2.5M.  Nelson will do\nthis; Graham will do this; I will do this; and your office (i.e., Nina,\nKathleen) can contact the right people in Department of Defense.  In the\ngrand scheme of things, $2.5M in the DoD budget is \"rounding errors\".\n\n                Other options:  1) We can keep everybody working until\nwe\nrun out of money, then let everybody (not just 70) go.  A bad option\nunless\nthere is a federal \"supplemental\" (which given a state of war, there\nprobably will be).  2) We find alternative sources of money (US\nCongress,\nexisting National Guard allocations, etc. -- but not state money).  3)\nWrap\nthis up with terrorist-related National Guard issues.\n\n                Bottom line:  I will work.  It will be news (tomorrow),\nbut\nnot earthshattering news.  I think we can fix it.  Too soon to spend\nyour\ncoin on something that can probably be worked out at lower level.\n\n\nJim","id":"20020112-2265699E79C5D51197940002B31B4EDB3E1FE4@exchange.fdle.gov","subject":"RE: URGENT/IMPORTANT: GUARD ISSUE","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T18:39:35-06:00"},{"from":"\"Jeb Bush\" <MAILER-DAEMON>","to":"'Goins, Vickie'; Shanahan, Kathleen; Yablonski, Brian; Jimenez, Frank; Baur, Katie; Hirst, Elizabeth; Busse, Mark","date":"Sun, 13 Jan 2002 00:52:01 +0000","message":"this is great! \n \n\nJeb Bush \n\n***********************************************************\nPlease note: Florida has a very broad public records law.\nMost written communications to or from state officials\nregarding state business are public records available to the\npublic and media upon request.

Polk County, as I have written to you many times about, is a clear reflection of those problems. With a 52% graduation rate, a dropout rate of nearly 6%, and a teenage pregnancy rate that equals 82 girls per 1000 of unwed mothers...something is drastically wrong!\n \nOur school superintendent announced his intentions to release a large portion of the truancy officers here citing budget difficulties...another low blow to an already failing institution. I have read you bulletins describing increased educational dollars, but it is not enough to do anything more than keep step with inflation.\n \nOn one page published by the DOE (http://www.firn.edu/doe/monday/2002pdf/2002-01.pdf) I read one thing about how changes to the state's are being made to the school accountability grading system. And on another page I read something that shatters the theory (as applied here in Polk County, and as I suspect around the state) about how the  CALCULATION OF STUDENT SCORES ( http://www.firn.edu/doe/commhome/ess-hot.htm ) of students with disabilities are not included in the calculation for school achievement levels. As it is presently, only students who are speech impaired and hospital/homebound are included in this calculation. Students with language impairments have been excused from being included also (The Department recently revised State Board of Education Rule 6A-1.09981). This clearly explains the district's push for getting kids into the ESE program, often even with parental objections going unheard. The district receives a \"double dip\" in a funding advantage by placing borderline students into the ESE program, along with any student that might fit the ESE criteria ( a child that wears glasses qualifies for ESE)...first by collecting higher funding $$$'s for them, and second by not including these students in the calculations. We all know this from past experiences, conversations, and letters we received from parents (Parental Action Committee) that the push for placing students into the ESE program was excessive.\nWith the ESE program receiving a much higher rate in the funding level than regular students, and then these students achievement levels are not counted in the district's funding scores under the A+ Plan, it doesn't take much common sense to understand why.\n \nAnother concern is the Senate Bill SB382, that is a resurrection of a failed Bill from last year (S310 and S380). The language of this Bill has in it a method for districts to raise money through a surtax. But SB382 refers to Capital Expenses ONLY! \nCapital money is used primarily to pay for building construction and renovation, but not building maintenance. Capital money also covers the cost of other big-ticket items such as school buses and computers (SAP/R3).\nUnlike county and municipal governments, school districts cannot mix capital and operating expenses. Operating funds cover the day-to-day expense of running the school district. Salaries, supplies, student transportation, and building maintenance are all included in the operating budget. \n  \nThis means NONE of this money derived from the surtax could be used for anything other than capital expenses...new schools and school renovations! NO WAGE INCREASES FROM THIS TAX>>>PERIOD!\nThe amount of information about this surtax in this Bill is NOT reaching the citizens of this state, and so there is this mistaken belief that by supporting a surtax increase for the school district it would help the teacher wage problem, or help in reducing the student/teacher ratio, or help in keeping those truant officers employed in order to reduce the dropout rates, or any thing else the citizens may have thought. \nWRONG!\n \nThis Bill WILL help build more schools, and make the building of those new schools better because corners will not have to be cut, because of funding. It will also help in getting rid of those ugly portable classrooms we all hate. And the gyms, music buildings, cafeterias, and the like could also be built where needed. But what this will ultimately do is create unusable square footage of building space...BECAUSE...the state continues to short school districts on operating funding! AND the school district's school board continues to go unchecked with their un-satisfiable appetite for spending operating funds in a crazy manner.\n \nThe rest of the SB382 Bill looks pretty good as it puts increased pressure on the growth management issue going unchecked, and it FORCES the builders, county governments, and school districts to work together in reducing the problems incurred with unchecked growth. If we could only get the wording changed a wee little bit on this SB382 Bill that would allow a certain portion of the surtax to be used by the school district for operating expenses that are SENSIBLE (teacher and support personnel wages???)...\nwe just might have a good Bill that we all could support. Mandatory impact fees for new growth should be included in this Bill also.\n \nI am just a little guy (we met at the \"Capital for the Day\" gathering in Bartow) who has allot of ideas and interest in correcting problems this district has. I work very hard to bring these problems and ideas to the people of Polk County. I believe until eyes are opened and good information is provided, changes will not happen. I am redesigning my Web page to hopefully reach more people (www.Polk-ed.com) about educational issues. My work for the most part goes unnoticed, and my thoughts and ideas go unheard, but I continue with my efforts in the hopes that I might make a difference for the better in the future of our youth.\n \nOne last thing I would like to say...good work on the terrorist threat on your life. Many people would disagree with me politically, but I do like you and your efforts to make Florida a better place. As with any political hotseat, you have received your unfair amount of criticism. I myself have a saying...\"There are NO valid excuses for elected officials. There are however, some bad decision makers!\" Hopefully in the coming elections, some... if not all, of those bad decision makers will be replaced.\n \nThank you, \n \nBryan Siddell\nbfsid@ithink.net","id":"20020112-003501c19bcd$f8736e80$100bbecf@robert","subject":"letter to the Governor 02/12/02","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T19:02:23-06:00"},{"from":"\"Jeb Bush\" <MAILER-DAEMON>","to":"Douglas.

The Boards mind was \nmade up to destroy Dr. Phillips to serve their main purpose : keep amalgam\nin \nour mouths.\nWho will profit from this law?\n\nMy impression is also that the board itself would not have been able to put \nthis plan together and I suspect the Quackbuster Group is the master mind.\nShould you not know about their activities please go to\nwww.saveDrClark.org, \nand then click on : by whom, how and why is she being attacked..  It makes \ninteresting reading.  To use a Board though is easier,they have all the \nauthority.\n\nThe only real witness against Dr. Phillips was one Robert Baratz who is tied\n\nin with the Quackbusters (ergo my suspicions about there involvement). He \nlied repeatedly under oath, and the Board, although they know about it,\nstill \nuse him. Is Baratz the main actor or does the Board also consist of \nQuackbusters and they are using Baratz as an authority to say what they must\n\nhave on record to allow them to do what they had planned to do?\n\n                                                         Makes one wonder \nabout their integrity.\n\nThe law that would keep amalgam in our mouth seems to me to violate the \nHippocratic oath : do no harm ! The Board might set themselves up for a \nfuture class\naction suit.\n\nIn addition I think the Board should have at least one \"alternative\" dentist\n\non board, \nconsidering how many Floridians are dedicated to natural medicine.\nThank you for reading my letter, and I hope very much you will consider \nlooking into this matter.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                           \n                                           Sincerely,\n\n                                        \n                                                            Britta Mackey","id":"20020113-311EC6B4B5614744B91D69784B12250B287A6D@exch2000.jeb.org","subject":"FW: (no subject)","dateCentral":"2002-01-12T19:17:26-06:00"},{"from":"\"Jeb Bush\" <MAILER-DAEMON>","to":"Liza McFadden (E-mail)","date":"Sun, 13 Jan 2002 01:18:59 +0000","message":"have you contacted them? any thoughts?\n \n\nJeb Bush \n\n***********************************************************\nPlease note: Florida has a very broad public records law.\nMost written communications to or from state officials\nregarding state business are public records available to the\npublic and media upon request.

We know that the director of the k-3\nprogram at the FLaRE center was \"kicked out\" of Texas. That may just be\nTexas speak, but Joe Torgesen has echoed the sentiment.  The concern is that\nthe FLaRE center people might not share the same philosophy on reading\ninstruction as the feds.  The center was set up mainly as a clearinghouse\nfor materials and resources on reading and as a professional development\ndelivery system -- that's why the research center at FSU would help -- we\ncould make sure that the pd being delivered through FLaRE was based on sound\nresearch.  I understand that Kim McDougal had a productive meeting with\nRepresentative Lynn on Friday, and explained to her that Torgesen's \"stamp\nof approval\" could help the center go a long way with the feds.  Betty Coxe\nand I are meeting with her on Monday, and would think that the idea of\nforging some partnership with FSU/Torgesen would be a positive one.

We have some federal\nmoney (from the old federal reading grant) that we could use for this\neffort.  \n\nPrivate sector -- Liza, Cheryl and I are meeting with a woman from Florida\nPower on Monday who wants to channel money to birth-preK.

We know that the director of the k-3\nprogram at the FLaRE center was \"kicked out\" of Texas. That may just be\nTexas speak, but Joe Torgesen has echoed the sentiment.  The concern is that\nthe FLaRE center people might not share the same philosophy on reading\ninstruction as the feds.  The center was set up mainly as a clearinghouse\nfor materials and resources on reading and as a professional development\ndelivery system -- that's why the research center at FSU would help -- we\ncould make sure that the pd being delivered through FLaRE was based on sound\nresearch.  I understand that Kim McDougal had a productive meeting with\nRepresentative Lynn on Friday, and explained to her that Torgesen's \"stamp\nof approval\" could help the center go a long way with the feds.
